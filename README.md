## Project Overview: Statistical Analysis

This project outlines the key steps for conducting a thorough statistical analysis to explore and interpret a chosen dataset with depth and precision:

- **Notebook Creation**:  
  Develop a Python notebook dedicated to the statistical study of the selected dataset.  

- **Ongoing Documentation**:  
  Add detailed comments throughout the process and save the notebook regularly.  

- **Univariate Analysis**:  
  Perform a univariate statistical study for each variable.  

- **Outlier Investigation**:  
  Conduct a separate analysis of potential outliers in the data.  

- **Problem Selection**:  
  Identify 5-6 compelling questions linking multiple variables.  

- **Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis**:  
  Carry out an in-depth statistical study for each of these questions.  

- **Nuanced Answers**:  
  Provide thoughtful and nuanced responses to each question.  

- **Final Synthesis**:  
  Retain the three most interesting questions and leverage the other analyses to validate additional grading criteria if needed.
